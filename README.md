## Evaluate-Lip-reading-using-Deep-Learning-Techniques.
This paper explores Silent Sound Technology, focusing on its potential to enhance communication in noisy environments through lip-reading and deep learning, with applications in hearing aids and security.

## Dataset:
LRW, GRID, LRS2, LRS3-TED, VoxCeleb2, CAS-VSR-W1k(LRW-1000

## Proposed Methodology
In this section, we describe the methodology employed for preprocessing video data,
aligning it with textual content, and training a neural network model for a specific
task. The proposed methodology encompasses data loading, data preprocessing, and
model training.
